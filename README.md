# homebrew-charitybell

Just a collection of homebrew formulae that aren't already available in [homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core). Some of these are packages that can't be distributed due to licensing issues, some of them need a bit of work before being merged into homebrew-core.

## License

I don't think homebrew formulae are copyrightable, but just in case, the formulae here are licensed under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org). This license only applies to the formulae in this repository, it does not apply to any of the code fetched by the formulae, or any of the resulting binaries.
